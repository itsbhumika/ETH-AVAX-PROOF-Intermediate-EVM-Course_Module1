Overview:
The `trafficManagement` contract manages vehicle details and path selection. It defines a `vehicle` struct with attributes like name, wheels, length, and path distance. Functions allow adding vehicle details (`putDetails`), selecting paths (`selectPath`), checking path suitability (`pathCheck`), and retrieving user info (`getUserInfo`). Conditions ensure suitable path usage based on vehicle characteristics and path conditions.

Description:
1. Contract Definition: The code defines a Solidity smart contract named `trafficManagement` that manages vehicle information and traffic paths.
2. Data Structure: It includes a `struct` named `vehicle` to store details such as vehicle name, number of wheels (`nWheels`), length of the vehicle (`lengthOfVehicle`), and path distance (`pathDistance`).
3. Storage: The contract uses a mapping (`map`) to associate each user's Ethereum address with their `vehicle` struct, storing details of vehicles they register.
4. Functionality:
   - `putDetails` Function: Allows users to register their vehicle details. It checks if the number of wheels is between 1 to 6 and then stores the vehicle details in the `map`.
   - `selectPath` Function: Helps users decide between a main path and an alternate path based on conditions (`alterDistance`, `mainCount`, `alterCount`). If conditions are met, it 
        suggests the optimal path; otherwise, it advises using the main path only.
   - `pathCheck` Function: Verifies if a selected path (`pathDetail`) is non-commercial and suitable for shorter vehicles (`lengthOfVehicle` <= 2). If valid, it confirms the path can be 
        used.
   - `getUserInfo` Function: Retrieves stored vehicle details for the caller's address, returning the vehicle's name, number of wheels, length, and path distance.
5. Modifiers: The code uses modifiers (`require`, `revert`, `assert`) to enforce conditions such as valid wheel count, path suitability, and non-commercial status.
6. License: The code specifies that it is licensed under the MIT License (`SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`), ensuring open-source availability and usage.

This contract essentially manages vehicle data, helps users make path decisions based on conditions, and ensures paths meet specified criteria for vehicle type and commercial use.
This contract aims to enforce rules for traffic management, suggesting safe and appropriate routes based on vehicle characteristics and road conditions.
